            <p class="text-muted">My name is Nolonwabo Mahanjana. I was born in a small town called Nqamakwe in Eastern Cape. <br>I grew up in a big family i learned very quickly that inorder to be heard you have to speak louder more than any one.<br> I moved to Cape town
              when i was still very young, I did my primary and high school in township i then move around trying to find my passion.<br> In 2012 i got accepted at Walter Sisulu University to study Information Technology(Bussiness Analyst). After i finished
              my diploma i come back to Cape town and i become a Volunteer at YearBeyond where i was a tutoring Maths and English in primary school. When i was busy doing volunteerer work i had about codeX and i decide to be part of this programme since
              i was already in a field of I.t but not a software programmer since in businness analyst they not focused in programming alot.</p>
